# Go to Line Start.sugar

This Sugar adds an alternate "Go to Line" action inspired by [Brent Simmons' preferences](http://inessential.com/2011/11/27/mac_text_editors_and_navigation).

After installing the action use `control L` or **Actions&rarr;Go to Line Start...** to jump to the start of any line in the active document.

## Installation

You can download a compiled version of Go to Line Start.sugar here:

<https://github.com/downloads/onecrayon/GoToLineStart-sugar/GoToLineStart.sugar.zip>

Alternatively, you can clone this GitHub repo, open the XCode project, and compile it yourself. If you have your Espresso application stored anywhere other than the root Applications directory, you will need to first modify the ESPRESSO\_PATH build setting for the "Go to Line Start" target.
